# Google Computer Science Summer Institute    
Seattle, WA - July 2018   |   Project - Tutoriffic

Participated in an intensive three-week programming institute learning web app, development in Python, HTML5, and Google AppEngine from Google engineers.

Through the creation of various small projects we used python and multiple APIs to create tutoriffic-catalyst.appspot.com, a website that allows users to look for or offer homework help to fellow students.
