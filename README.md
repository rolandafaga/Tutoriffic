Google Computer Science Summer Institute  |  
Seattle, WA - July 2018

Participated in an intensive programming institute learning web app, development in Python, HTML5, and
Google AppEngine from Google engineers.

Through the creation of various small projects I used python and multiple APIs to create tutoriffic-catalyst.appspot.com, 
a website that allows users to look for or offer homework help to fellow students.
